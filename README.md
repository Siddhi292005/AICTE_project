Plant Disease Detection System
This project focuses on leveraging technology to accurately identify diseases in plants using image processing and machine learning techniques. Developed as part of a learning initiative under the guidance of Edunet Foundation, the system aims to assist farmers and agricultural professionals in early detection and effective management of plant diseases.

Overview
The Plant Disease Detection System is an AI-driven solution designed to:

Analyze images of plant leaves.
Identify diseases affecting the plant.
Provide actionable insights and potential remedies.
The system is an effort to bridge the gap between advanced technology and agriculture, enabling sustainable farming practices and minimizing crop losses.

Key Features
Image Analysis: Upload images of plant leaves to detect diseases.
Machine Learning Model: Trained on a dataset of plant diseases to ensure accurate predictions.
User-Friendly Interface: Simple and intuitive UI for non-technical users.
Actionable Insights: Provides disease details and possible solutions.
Technologies Used
Programming Language: Python
Libraries and Frameworks:
TensorFlow/Keras: For building and training the machine learning model.
Streamlit For developing the web interface.
Tools: Jupyter Notebook, Visual Studio Code
Dataset: Publicly available plant disease datasets (e.g., PlantVillage).

How It Works
Image Upload: The user uploads an image of a plant leaf.
Preprocessing: The system processes the image (resizing, normalization, etc.).
Prediction: A machine learning model classifies the image into disease categories.
Output: The system displays the detected disease and suggested remedies.
